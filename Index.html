    <h1>Does the United States Have a Gun Problem?</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <!--<h2>Number of Guns in the United States vs. Number of Guns in other Countries:</h2>-->
        <p>Does the United States have a gun problem? I think anyone who is aware of the unavoidable amount of mass shootings that have been<br />
            occurring in the country can answer that without a doubt. It has been a hot topic during the past few years since mass shootings have<br />
            become somewhat common to hear about in the news, unfortunately. President Obama addressed the nation 12 different times talking<br />
            about 12 different mass shootings throughout his two term presidency alone.<br />
                <br />
            This first visualization sheds the light on a few different crucial points. Starting with the percentage of the population that owns guns<br />
            in each state, the darker the state, the higher it's percentage of gun owners is. Then, the visualization shows the amount of guns in each<br />
            individual state and comparesit to an entire country which has the closest approximate number of guns.<br />
            Remember, this is state vs country. Insane.<br />
                 <br />
            So, how bad is the gun problem in the United States? Pretty horrible as most people would imagine.<br />

        <p><p>
        Now, what if we took a look at each state again, but this time compared the number of that state’s human population, the gray bar chart, against<br />
        the approximate number of it’s gun population, in red. The gun problem in the United States might be worse than you think.<br />

            We clearly have a large problem at hand. Each of the different mass shootings had a different reason that fueled the shooter. However, getting access<br />
            to those weapons has proven to be fairly easy, and, as we see over and over again, its bound to fall into the hands of the wrong people who can easily<br />
            use them hurt so many innocent people around them.<br />
