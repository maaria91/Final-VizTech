    <h1>Does the United States Have a Gun Problem?</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <!--<h2>Number of Guns in the United States vs. Number of Guns in other Countries:</h2>-->
        <p>Does the United States have a gun problem? I think anyone who is aware about the unavoidable amount of mass shootings that have been <br />
            occurring in the country can answer that  without a doubt. It has been a hot topic during the past few years since mass shootings <br />
            have become somewhat common, unfortunately. President Obama addressed the nation 12 different times about 12 different mass shootings<br />
            throughout his two term presidency alone. The number of mass shootings in 2015 have exceeded the number of days.  <br />
                 <br />
            So, how bad is the gun problem in the United States?<br />
            Pretty horrible as most people would imagine. <br />
                <br />
            This first visualization shows the amount of guns in each individual state and shows you the entire country which has the closest approximate<br />
            number of guns. The darker the red the more guns the state has.<br />Remember, this is state vs country. Insane.<br />

        <h2>Number of the Humans Population vs Number of Guns in each State:</h2>
        <p><p>
        Now, what if we took a look at each state again, but this time compared the number of their human population, the orange bar chart, against <br /> the number of their approximate gun population, in red.
        The gun problem in the United States might be worse than you think.

            We clearly have a large problem at hand. Each of the different shootings had a different reason that fueled the shooter. However, getting access to those weapons has proven<br />
            to be fairly easy, and, as we see over and over again, it tends to fall into the hands of the wrong people who can easily hurt so many people around them.<br />
